# cardio-papers
This is a collection of papers related to my research in cardiovascular modeling in some way or another. The purpose of this repository is to act like an annotated bibliography for papers that I have read during my PhD research at Carnegie Mellon University, for quick reference when trying to recall and relocate papers. 

See [**list.md**](https://github.com/danemerson13/cardio-papers/blob/main/list.md) for a listing of papers reverse chronological list of papers (*based on when I first read the paper*) with a link and keywords. <br> 
In the future I may include brief descriptions or annotations of papers. 

While primarily for my personal use, I am making this repository publically visible for other researchers to refer to. If you are an author of a listed paper and would like it to be removed, please email me (danielem [AT] andrew.cmu.edu).
