# cardio-papers
This is a collection of papers that are related to my research in cardiovascular modeling in some way or another. The purpose of this repository is to act like an annotated bibliography for papers that I have read during my PhD research at Carnegie Mellon University, for quick reference when trying to recall and relocate papers. 

While primarily for my personal use, I am making this repository publically visible for other researchers to refer to. If you are an author of a listed paper and would like it to be removed, please email me (danielem [AT] andrew.cmu.edu).
